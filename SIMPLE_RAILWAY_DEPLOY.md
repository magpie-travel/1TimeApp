# Simple Railway Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Build Configuration Ready**
- `nixpacks.toml` configured to use `npm run build`
- Uses existing `vite.config.ts` (no custom config needed)
- Simplified deployment process

## Deploy Steps

### 1. Upload to GitHub
Upload these files to your GitHub repository:
- `nixpacks.toml`
- `railway.json` 
- All your existing project files

### 2. Deploy on Railway
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create new project → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select your repository
5. Railway will automatically build using `npm run build`

### 3. Add Environment Variables (After Initial Deploy)
In Railway dashboard, add these under "Variables":

**Required for App to Function:**
```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=any_random_32_character_string
NODE_ENV=production
```

**Required for Firebase Auth:**
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
```

### 4. App Should Work
- Railway will deploy successfully
- Environment variables control runtime behavior
- Build errors are separate from missing environment variables

## Notes
- **Build Process**: Uses standard `npm run build` command
- **Missing Env Vars**: Won't cause build failures, only runtime issues
- **First Deploy**: App may not work until you add environment variables
- **Custom Domain**: Add in Railway dashboard after successful deployment

The build should complete successfully on Railway even without environment variables set up initially.
