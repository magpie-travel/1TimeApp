# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Current Status
✅ Build system is working correctly  
✅ Vercel configuration files are ready  
✅ API endpoint is properly configured  
✅ Static files build successfully  

## Files Created for Vercel:
- `vercel.json` - Vercel configuration
- `api/index.ts` - Serverless function entry point

## Environment Variables Required on Vercel:
You need to add these environment variables in your Vercel dashboard:

1. `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL database connection string
2. `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key for AI features

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Connect to Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your project from GitHub/GitLab

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add the required environment variables above

3. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy
   - Build command: `npm run build:client`
   - Output directory: `dist/public`

## Current Configuration:
- Frontend: Static files served from `dist/public`  
- Backend: Serverless functions in `/api` directory
- API routes: Available at `/api/*` paths

## Testing Deployment:
After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `/` - Main app (Timeline page)
- `/create` - Memory creation page
- `/api/health` - API health check

The UI and functionality remain exactly the same as your current app.
